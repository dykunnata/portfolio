<div class="bigtext">


  
<p>
        So… Why would you even want to read this huge text wall describing someone’s life journey?
        It must be so boring...
        
        Let me change this concept a bit and try to prove it’s not as it seems to be. </p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Hello! I am Nataliia Dykun.</span></p>
        
        <p>First thing I’d like to tell about me - I am a human. This fact gives me great opportunities - to see, to hear, to feel, to think, to talk, to create.I can proudly say that for years of my life so far I have mastered most of them :) </p>
        
        <p>Secondly, I have been learning all my life - Languages, Literature, Travel business, Hospitality sphere, Visa and Passport Documentation process, Linux administration and customer IT support, User Experience, UI Design, Coding with HTML, CSS and JavaScript… to be continued. Step by step to the dream.</p>
        
        <p>Thirdly, each my job experience was like acquiring stakes to once become a millionaire: when I was an English teacher for corporate customers, they liked me because I could make them learn and keep under pressure. They literally asked for strict organization and demandive style.</p>
        <p><span class="point"><strong>Features: </strong>organization, demandive style, confidence.</span></p>
        
        <p>Travel agency work has taught me how to talk to people, how to convince them, how to provide them options of choice so we could choose what they want and be happy. Both!  (It was a period of “What?”, “How?”, “When?”, “Where?”, “How many?”, “O, really?” questions.)</p>
        <p><span class="point"><strong>Another set:</strong> Ability to listen, to tell stories, to search for information, to provide options.</span></p>
        
        <p>Jobs at hospitality environment helped me to observe so many different people with so many characters that now I would think twice before suggesting anything  to a person I don’t know.
        Here is a good recommendation: first get to know your client and then attack them with your ideas. Because sometimes, when offering a man to buy a toothpaste, you can find out that he doesn’t have teeth. Embarrassing? O, yeah!</p>
        <p><span class="point">Traits: Gather information, analyse, generate ideas.</span></p>
        
        <p>Working in the office that deals with documentation gave me understanding how important is the structure and view of those forms: what we see, how intuitive and logical the form must be, can everyone use it easily? With the help of few lines and words on a screen you can either attract a person or scare them to ever come back.</p>
        <p><span class="point">What we get: Think what you try to achieve, why you need this, and how to do it. Make a plan.</span></p>
        
        <p>All IT experience helped to understand something “not understandable” - machines which live their lives, which can listen to your commands and answer in errors if they don’t like something. How important is to understand that error? It’s a core: no cause - no fix, no fix - no success. You can swirl round and round, create new ideas and all in vain. Why? Because you don’t know what’s wrong. I had an experience at my work when we were sitting with customer trying to resolve an issue for 4 days and nights, literally. Till we checked the simplest thing one would never thought about and it was wrong, it was a reason. </p>
        <p><span class="point">Take-away: sometimes you don’t need to demolish all the theater building  because people don’t attend it often, maybe it’s just worth creating brighter signboard.</span></p>
        
        <p>Summarizing all said above I can assure - if you need a person who understands people’s minds, who can create ideas and then implement them - stop looking. I am here.</p>
        
        <p>Besides I’m a sun-and-ocean fan, hiker, social latin dancer, event organizer and enthusiast traveler.</p>
        
        <p>Thanks for your interest! </p>
